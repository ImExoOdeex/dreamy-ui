# Why beta?

To create a stable component library, it is needed to bug hunt all the code, write better docs and gather some feedback. Without that things are more likely to break in users' apps.

## When stable relase?

Dreamy UI will be released from beta when:
- All the components are done and are bug free. 
- Docs contain all the components possibilities.
- Framework installation guides are written.

## Coming components

Currently, following components must be done before Dreamy UI is released from beta:

- Circular Progress
- Editable
- Menu
- Radio
- Radio Card
- Select
- Skeleton
- Switch
- Toast
