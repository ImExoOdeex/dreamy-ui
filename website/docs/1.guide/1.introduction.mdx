# Introduction

Dreamy UI is a React UI library that provides a set of customizable components and utilities to build performant, websites with ease.

## Motivation

> info: Note: this isn't about which library is better, every library has its own pros and cons.

Many UI libraries are built on top of CSS-in-JS libraries like [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). These libraries provide a great developer experience, but they come with a cost: they use runtime CSS styles, which slow down rendering, performance and limit some features, like streaming, etc.

Dreamy UI is built on top of [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/), which is a CSS-in-JS library that provides strongly typed CSS styles, that are generated at **build time**, incredibly improving website performance and not decreasing developer experience.

## Solution

Introducing Dreamy UI, a library that allows you to write your favourite CSS-in-JS code, while still enjoying native CSS performance. Ba! Dream comes with many utilities to write your website even faster. **Boolean style props**. Let's say you are sure your flex component will be column, so instead of typing `flexDir="column"`, it is possible to write `col` or `column` as prop ðŸŽ‰. You can mix and use any styling style to your preference.

Dream is **highly customizable**, meaning you can change any component style in panda config. Dream Provider accepts only runtime props, for example: default animation transition, motion variants for animations, etc.

If you have had used any CSS-in-JS library, you are fully familiar with styling components and you'll have no problem with Dream.
